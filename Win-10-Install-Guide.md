TODOs:
-
- SysPrep testing and imaging
- WinEnabler method for creating Default Profile

Introduction:
-
This guide is created for creating your Windows 10 base images. With
Group Policy being its own beast, that will be added in a different
document. This guide assumes that you have the RSAT (Remote Server
Administration Tools) installed, and that you have an Active Directory
Domain Controller at your site.

Remove from domain
---
-   Must remove from Domain to capture image in FOG (?)

SysPrep Method
---
- Create your Answer file in the Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK)
	- Generate the Answer File on a "tech machine", not the machine you're attempting to image
	- Download and install the packages listed:
		- Deployment Tools
		- Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)
		- Configuration Designer
	- Open the **Windows System Image Manager** (WSIM) tool
		- Start->Windows Kits->Windows System Image Manager
	- File->Select Windows Image...
		- Browse to *X:\sources\install.WIM*, replacing the *X:* with the drive letter for the Windows 10 Install file
		- Click on **Yes** to create a catalog file (if prompted)
	- File->Create new Answer file
		- Browse the list of items, and add them as necessary
		- A demo file is available on the Tech Server - GitHub is too public
		- Critical Setting - Ensure "Copy Profile" is set to "True"
			- This copies the built-in Administrator profile to the Default User during SysPrep
- Save the .XML file to a shared drive, and move it to your computer under `C:\Windows\System32\SysPrep\<filename>.XML`
- Open the Administrative Command Prompt (<kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>)
- Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\SysPrep`
- Execute `sysprep /quiet /generalize /oobe /shutdown /unattend:<filename>.XML`
	- This command will read the XML file (ensure it's done correctly!), and reseal Windows
	- This command will shut down the system
	- On the NEXT BOOT, boot to FOG and grab an image. If Windows boots up (even partially), it will start generating the SIDs that need to be unique to each Windows system. Try, try again. If it's on a VM, save a snapshot BEFORE starting the VM back up, just in case
