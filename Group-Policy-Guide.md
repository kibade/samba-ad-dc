Group Policies
==============
*Version 0.1 - Initial Commit*  
&copy; 2017 - School District #57 (Prince George)

These settings should be created on the domain controller, then have the
Cron Job setup to `rsync` the primary to the secondary controllers. You
will need to make sure your AD Structure is setup properly to start. We
will be setting 6 policies - User configurations and Computer
configurations, for Everyone, Staff, and Students.

Default\_Computer and Default\_User will apply to everyone. The Computer
settings will follow the computers wherever they are, whereas User
settings will follow the specific users logging in. If settings are not
applying, ensure that you are setting the right types of
polices/preferences in the right area.

Preparing to Manage Group Policies
---
1.  Install the RSAT (Remote System Administration Tools) for your version of Windows (NOTE: many policies for Windows 10 require you to login with a Windows 10 Pro or higher machine, and therefore, you need Windows 10 to set the GPs for those machines)
    
    [[Windows 10 RSAT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520)] - [[Windows 8.1 RSAT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=39296)] - [[Windows 7 RSAT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=7887)]
2. After installing the above tools, go to the **Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows Features on and off**. Search the list for *Remote Server Administration Tools*, and enable the option. After clicking <kbd>OK</kbd>, you may need to reboot your computer.

To create a new policy:
---
1.  Run `gpmc.msc` as a Domain Admin user.
2.  Expand the Forest \\ Domains \\ &lt;*School Code*&gt;.ad.sd57.bc.ca
3.  Right-click on the domain, choose "**Create a GPO in this domain, and
    Link it hereâ€¦**".
4.  Name the GPO to indicate what section you're in (i.e.
    "*Default\_Computer*)
5.  After you click <kbd>OK</kbd>, you'll be brought in to the Group Policy
    Management Editor. Make your changes, then close the window. You
    settings should apply to the Domain Controller right away.

If you need to see your settings take effect right away (i.e. test workstation), you can run `gpupdate /force` to download the latest GPOs for your session. If that does not work, log off and back on. Finally, try rebooting. If that still does not work, then ensure your computer is talking to the domain controller with the GPOs. If you have dual-domain controllers setup (recommended), you may need to wait for your `cron` job to start and finish to copy the policies to all the domain controllers.

Forest Structure
--- 
| -- Users  
| -- Computers  
| -- Domain Controllers  
| -- Staff  
.... | -- Staff\_Users  
.... | -- Staff\_Computers  
| -- Students  
.... | -- Student\_Users  
.... | -- Student\_Computers  

On each of the OUs (i.e. containers) above, you can apply Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to those groups. Apply the **Default\_Computer** and **Default\_User** policies to the Forest level (the local domain - ***&lt;schoolcode&gt;*.ad.sd57.bc.ca**). Under the extra OUs you create, attach policies for those areas.

The Group Policies will work from the top down, until it finds the User logged in, and the Computer logged in. GPOs from the server will run first, then the Local Group Policy will take effect on settings (the ones created with `gpedit.msc` on the local workstations). As of now, we will NOT be setting Local Group Policies on workstations, once Active Directory is setup and working. This will help prevent conflicts, and trying to find out where "different" settings are coming from.

With the forest structure, this will make it easier to "target" GPOs to different groups. After the structure has been created, you are free to fill it in with more OUs as you require for your site. We will want to work on keeping the 'Users' and 'Computers' container as *clean as possible*. Active Directory relies heavily on being maintained to keep it working well.

Policies vs Preferences
---
When you create a new GPO, you'll see two main sections under Computer or User Configuration: **Policies** and **Preferences**. Policies are *mandated* settings that are not to be changed. The programs that support Group Policy will not allow these settings to be changed within their respected programs if a policy is in place. Preferences are *preferred* and can be chosen to be policy or preference. For example, in the *Folder Options* window, you can specify certain settings that are set and *cannot be changed later*. The options can be chosen using the <kbd>F5</kbd> to <kbd>F8</kbd> keys. When the color is red/white the setting will not come into the play. In other words, you disable the option completely.

- <kbd>F5</kbd> activates all the options you see. Turning every option Green
- <kbd>F6</kbd> activates only the chosen setting. Turning it green (you can use TAB to choose or click it with your mouse)
- <kbd>F7</kbd> Disables only the chosen setting. Turning the color to red/white
- <kbd>F8</kbd> Disables all the settings. Turning every option into red/white
